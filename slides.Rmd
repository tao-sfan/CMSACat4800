## Introduction / Motivation

- Model ball movement dynamics with tracking data of only the ball (and not other players)

- To encapsulate the complex movement and forces acting on the ball into a much simpler, useful object

- A potential function is just an equation that model underlying forces

- Use this to approximate final game outcomes

## Random Walk

A sequence of some steps in random directions on some mathematical space.

- A point randomly moves along the integer line

- A point randomly moves on x-y plane

<!-- Sifan 2-->
## Potential Function

- Idea: The ball is a randomly drifting ball that is attracted to the goal by some "force". 

--

- We can try to model this underlying force based on the movements of the ball

--

- Our Potential Functions
  - Gravity

$$ V(x,y) = -\frac{G}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} $$

---
## Random Walk under Harmonic Potential Function
Using potential function as a guidance for random walk

--

- A step by the random particle under a force.
$$r(t_{i+1}) - r(t_i) = - \nabla V(r(t_i)) (t_{t+1} - t_i) + \sigma \sqrt{(t_{i+1} - t_i)} Z_{i+1}$$

--
<br>

- Small_Change = Estimated_Velocity x TimeStep + Noise

## Learning Potential Functions from Trajectories

- [Learning a Potential Function from a Trajectory -  Brillinger](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/tech-reports/723.pdf)

- Assumptions

--

  - Overdamped system, so force affects the velocity, not acceleration.
  - $V(x,y)$ can be approximated as a linear combination of basis functions
  
  
---

## The Basis Functions

- Our basis functions are a set of gravitational points on the field

- The Coefficients Scale the strength of the hole (Attractive or Repulsive)

$$V(x_i,y_i) = \sum - \frac{\beta_i}{\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2}} $$

<img src="./pics/basis_pic.png" width = "720px"/>


---

## Overview of the Potential Fitting Model

$$V(x,y) = \phi(x,y)^T \beta$$
$$Force = -\nabla V(x,y) = -\nabla \phi(x,y)^T \beta$$

--
$$Velocity \sim Force$$
--
$$\frac{dr}{dt} = - \nabla V(x,y)$$

## Other Baseline Comparisons

- Average has an MSE of 3.597692

- Fails to capture higher score differentials

## Other Baselines and Our Results

- Our model MSE = 3.379572 after 200 sims per game

- Arrives at the same conclusions as models trained exclusively on the data. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5}
all_scores %>% 
  group_by(match_id) %>% 
  summarize(pred_score_diff = mean(pred_score_diff), true_score_diff = mean(actual_score_diff)) %>% 
  mutate(residue = true_score_diff - pred_score_diff) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(y=true_score_diff, x=pred_score_diff), alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Potential Model Captures higher score differentials well \n and has slightly lower error than poisson") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 5,
                                  by = 1)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 10,
                                  by = 1))  +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, linetype="solid", color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=0,  linetype="solid", color = "blue") +
  coord_fixed(x = c(-5, 5), y = c(-5,5)) +
  xlab("Predicted Score Differential") + ylab("True Score Differential")
```

## Discussion and Future Work

- A proof of concept that potential functions can capture team dynamics, as can be seen by the score predictions.

- Lots of potential to improve the framework with more accurate sub-models

  - Shot Decision model and Goal Decision model
  
  - Incorporate team formation and score differential into the potential function
  
- This framework can be used to determine other things such as:

  - Player-based potential functions to determine player impacts
  
  - Real-Time Game Evaluation
